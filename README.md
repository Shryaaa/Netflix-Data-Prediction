# Netflix-Data-Prediction using Tableau

Creating a Netflix data prediction project using Tableau involves several steps. Here's a detailed guide:

### Step 1: Data Collection
1. **Identify Data Sources**: Determine where you will collect data from. This could be internal Netflix data (if available) or publicly available datasets related to Netflix.
2. **Data Gathering**: Collect relevant data such as user demographics, viewing history, ratings, content details (genres, actors, directors), and any other relevant information. Ensure the data is in a format compatible with Tableau.

### Step 2: Data Preparation
1. **Data Cleaning**: Clean the data to remove any inconsistencies, missing values, or irrelevant information. This step ensures that the data is accurate and ready for analysis.
2. **Data Integration**: Integrate different datasets if necessary, to combine relevant information into a single dataset for analysis.
3. **Data Transformation**: Transform the data as needed for analysis. This may include aggregating data, creating calculated fields, or deriving new variables.

### Step 3: Data Analysis and Visualization
1. **Connect Data to Tableau**: Import the prepared dataset into Tableau.
2. **Create Visualizations**: Use Tableau's drag-and-drop interface to create various visualizations such as bar charts, line graphs, scatter plots, etc., to explore patterns and trends in the data.
3. **Dashboard Creation**: Combine individual visualizations into interactive dashboards that provide a comprehensive view of the data. Dashboards should be user-friendly and intuitive.
4. **Apply Filters and Parameters**: Implement filters and parameters to allow users to interact with the data dynamically, enabling them to drill down into specific insights.

### Step 4: Prediction Modeling
1. **Identify Prediction Goals**: Determine what specific predictions you want to make based on the Netflix data. This could include predicting user preferences, content popularity, or future trends.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Select relevant features (variables) from the data that can be used to predict the target variable.
3. **Model Selection**: Choose appropriate prediction models such as regression, classification, or time series forecasting based on the nature of the prediction task.
4. **Train the Model**: Split the data into training and testing sets, and train the prediction model using the training data.
5. **Evaluate Model Performance**: Assess the performance of the trained model using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, etc.
6. **Predictive Analysis**: Use the trained model to make predictions on new data or future scenarios.

### Step 5: Deployment
1. **Publish to Tableau Server or Online**: Publish your Tableau dashboards and visualizations to Tableau Server or Tableau Online to share them with stakeholders.
2. **Scheduled Updates**: Set up scheduled updates for the data source to ensure that the visualizations reflect the latest data.
3. **Documentation and Maintenance**: Document the project including data sources, methodologies, and insights derived. Regularly maintain and update the project as needed.

### Step 6: Interpretation and Action
1. **Interpret Insights**: Analyze the visualizations and predictions to extract meaningful insights and actionable recommendations.
2. **Decision Making**: Use the insights derived from the analysis to make informed decisions related to content strategy, user experience improvements, marketing campaigns, etc.
3. **Iterative Process**: Continuously iterate on the analysis and predictions based on feedback and new data to improve the accuracy and relevance of the insights.

By following these steps, you can create a comprehensive Netflix data prediction project using Tableau, from data collection to deployment and action.
